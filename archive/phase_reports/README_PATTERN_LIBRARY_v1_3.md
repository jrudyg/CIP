## PURPOSE

This Pattern Library provides contract revision language for an **EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) System Integrator** specializing in technology and industrial automation projects.

**Optimization Focus:**
- **Quality:** Deliverables meet Owner specs, Supplier warranties cover gaps
- **Schedule:** Payment/approval timing aligned, no bottlenecks
- **Profit Margin:** No financing burden, scope defined, markup preserved

---

## USAGE GUIDANCE

### Who Should Use This

- In-house legal counsel
- Contract managers
- Project managers reviewing contracts
- Business development negotiating terms

### When to Use

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Reviewing new contract | Reference patterns by clause type |
| Negotiating terms | Use success rates and talking points |
| Assessing risk | Check DEALBREAKER and RESEARCH NEEDED patterns |
| Upstream (Owner) contract | Focus on Parts 2.1-2.3, 3.1, Cluster 4.2-4.3 |
| Downstream (Supplier) contract | Focus on Parts 2.4, 2.10, 3.1, Cluster 4.1 |

### How to Use

1. **Identify contract type:** Upstream, Downstream, Channel Partner, etc.
2. **Identify clause being reviewed:** Liability, Indemnification, Payment, etc.
3. **Find matching pattern:** Use Part 2 (Core) or Part 3 (Specialized)
4. **Check status:**
   - ✅ CONFIRMED = Ready to use
   - ❌ RESEARCH NEEDED = Do not use without further research
   - ⚠️ Notes = Read carefully for context-specific guidance
5. **Apply revision language** with adjustments for context
6. **Check dependencies** listed in pattern

---

## PATTERN STATUS KEY

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ✅ CONFIRMED | User validated pattern | Safe to use |
| ❌ RESEARCH NEEDED | Requires additional research | Do NOT use until researched |
| ❌ DEALBREAKER | Should not be in contract | Negotiate removal or walk away |
| ❌ LEGAL REVIEW | Needs legal counsel input | Escalate before using |

---

## CRITICAL STAGE RESTRICTIONS

### MNDA/NDA Stage - DO NOT APPLY:
- 2.4.1 Customer Protection Period
- 2.4.2 Commission on Direct Sales (DEALBREAKER anyway)
- 3.1.1 Customer Protection Complete
- 3.2.6 Competitor-as-Supplier Protection

**Rationale:** Customer protection patterns only apply to commercial agreements, not preliminary NDAs.

### CEO Decision Required:
- 2.7.1 Limited Exclusivity
- 2.7.2 Performance-Based Exclusivity
- Any exclusivity commitment of any kind

**Rationale:** Exclusivity commitments have strategic business implications beyond legal terms.

### Insurance Broker Approval Required:
- 3.2.5 Time & Materials Markup (insurance component)
- Any insurance limit changes
- Any additional insured requirements

**Rationale:** Insurance terms must be validated against actual coverage availability.

## IP OWNERSHIP FRAMEWORK

| IP Type | Ownership | Licensing |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Pre-existing IP | Ours | May license to customer |
| SOW Deliverables | Customer | N/A |
| Improvements to Pre-existing | Ours | May license to customer |

**Phase Restrictions:**
- Software license transfer (3.1.4) only applies in **implementation stage**
- Does NOT apply in concept or design phases unless explicitly specified in SOW

---

## DOCUMENT PLACEMENT GUIDANCE

| Item | Place In | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Milestone structure | SOW | Keeps MSA flexible |
| Markup percentages | MSA (preferred) or SOW | Establish upfront if possible |
| Acceptance criteria | SOW | Project-specific |
| Flowdown requirements | Provided during bidding | Supplier needs to price accordingly |
| Final executed copies | Upon award | Formal compliance trigger |
