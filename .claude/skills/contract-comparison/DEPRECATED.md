# DEPRECATED

This skill has been deprecated in favor of the new **cip-document-generation** skill.

## Deprecation Date
November 29, 2025

## Replacement
Use the **cip-document-generation** skill instead, which provides:

1. **Contract Risk Review** - Initial contract analysis with risk ratings, heat map, and negotiation playbook
2. **Suggested Redlines and Revisions** - Proposed changes with before/after risk matrix
3. **Version Comparison** - Enhanced comparison with delta analysis and grouped tables (replaces this skill)

## Migration Notes

The new skill provides all the functionality of this skill plus:
- Better visual formatting with colored risk indicators
- More comprehensive report components
- Database integration with reports.db
- Proper versioning support
- Three-tier clause weighting (Critical/High/Standard)
- Key themes organized by clause priority

## Usage

Instead of using this skill, invoke the new skill:
```
Generate a version comparison report for [contract name]
```

The new skill will guide you through the same workflow with enhanced output.
