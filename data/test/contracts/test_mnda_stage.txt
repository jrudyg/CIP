    (b) was lawfully in the Receiving Party's possession before disclosure, as evidenced by written records;

    (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information;

    (d) is lawfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it without restriction.

    (b) cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy;

    (c) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required; and

    (d) use reasonable efforts to ensure that any disclosed information is treated confidentially.

8. EQUITABLE RELIEF

8.1 Each Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate.

8.2 Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages.
