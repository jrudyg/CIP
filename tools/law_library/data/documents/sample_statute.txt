CHAPTER 21 - CIVIL RIGHTS

§ 1983. Civil action for deprivation of rights

Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.

For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

Originally enacted as Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. The statute was designed to provide a federal remedy for the deprivation of constitutional rights by state actors.

ELEMENTS

To establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must prove:

1. The defendant acted under color of state law
2. The defendant's conduct deprived the plaintiff of a right secured by the Constitution or federal law

COLOR OF STATE LAW

"Under color of state law" means the defendant exercised power possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law. This includes:

- Actions by state officials in their official capacity
- Actions by private parties acting in concert with state officials
- Actions pursuant to state custom or policy

QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

State officials sued under Section 1983 may assert qualified immunity as a defense. Qualified immunity shields officials from liability unless:

1. They violated a constitutional right
2. The right was clearly established at the time of the violation

REMEDIES

Successful Section 1983 plaintiffs may recover:

- Compensatory damages for actual injuries
- Nominal damages for violations without proven injury
- Punitive damages in cases of malicious or reckless conduct
- Injunctive relief to prevent ongoing violations
- Declaratory relief
- Attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

Section 1983 claims are subject to the statute of limitations for personal injury actions in the state where the claim arose, typically 2-3 years.
