OPINION

Filed: November 15, 2023

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California
Josephine L. Staton, District Judge, Presiding

BEFORE: McKEOWN, M. SMITH, and COLLINS, Circuit Judges

McKEOWN, Circuit Judge:

This appeal presents questions about the application of qualified immunity in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 excessive force case. We must determine whether Deputy Sheriff Robert Johnson violated Jane Martinez's clearly established Fourth Amendment rights when he used force during her arrest, and if so, whether qualified immunity shields him from liability.

I. BACKGROUND

On the evening of March 15, 2020, Deputy Johnson responded to a report of a domestic disturbance at an apartment complex in Riverside, California. Upon arrival, Johnson encountered Jane Martinez in the parking lot. Martinez, who suffers from bipolar disorder and was experiencing a mental health crisis, was agitated and speaking loudly but was not armed or physically threatening anyone.

According to Martinez's testimony, when Johnson approached, she asked to speak with a mental health crisis counselor. Johnson ordered her to calm down and place her hands behind her back. When Martinez did not immediately comply, Johnson grabbed her arm, forced her to the ground, and placed his knee on her back while handcuffing her. Martinez sustained bruising and a fractured wrist during the encounter.

Johnson testified that he perceived Martinez as potentially dangerous due to her erratic behavior and refused to comply with his commands. He stated that he used only the force necessary to secure the scene and protect himself and others.

The district court granted summary judgment to Johnson on the basis of qualified immunity, finding that while Johnson may have used excessive force, the constitutional right at issue was not clearly established at the time of the incident. Martinez timely appealed.

II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW

We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Keates v. Koile, 883 F.3d 1228, 1234 (9th Cir. 2018).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Qualified Immunity Framework

"Qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct." Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 664 (2012). To overcome qualified immunity, a plaintiff must show: (1) the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right, and (2) the right was clearly established at the time of the violation. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009).

We may address these prongs in any order. Id. at 236. "A right is clearly established when, at the time of the challenged conduct, the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right." Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).

B. Constitutional Violation

The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable seizures, including the use of excessive force during an arrest. Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394-95 (1989). We assess the reasonableness of force "from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight." Id. at 396.

We consider three factors: (1) the severity of the crime at issue, (2) whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and (3) whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight. Id. at 396.

Applying these factors, we find that Johnson's use of force was constitutionally excessive. First, Martinez was suspected at most of disturbing the peace, a minor offense. Second, Martinez posed no immediate threat—she was unarmed, not physically aggressive, and surrounded by responding officers. Third, while Martinez did not immediately comply with Johnson's commands, she was not actively resisting or attempting to flee. She simply requested to speak with a crisis counselor, a reasonable request given her mental health condition.

Moreover, this court has held that "officers must account for the mental state of the person being seized when determining the reasonable amount of force." Drummond v. City of Anaheim, 343 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir. 2003). Johnson knew or should have known that Martinez was experiencing a mental health crisis, which required a more measured response than immediate physical force.

Johnson's decision to forcibly take Martinez to the ground and place his knee on her back was unreasonable under the circumstances. Less intrusive alternatives were available, including verbal de-escalation or waiting for mental health professionals to arrive.

C. Clearly Established Right

Having determined that Johnson violated Martinez's Fourth Amendment rights, we turn to whether the right was clearly established.

The district court erred in concluding that the right was not clearly established. At the time of the incident in March 2020, it was clearly established in this circuit that "officers may not use significant force against a person who is mentally ill, has committed no serious crime, and is not resisting arrest or posing a threat to others." Tatum v. City & County of San Francisco, 441 F.3d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 2006).

This court has repeatedly held that the use of force against non-threatening individuals experiencing mental health crises violates the Fourth Amendment. See Drummond, 343 F.3d at 1058; Bryan v. MacPherson, 630 F.3d 805, 829 (9th Cir. 2010); Gravelet-Blondin v. Shelton, 728 F.3d 1086, 1093 (9th Cir. 2013).

These cases provided "fair warning" to Johnson that his conduct was unconstitutional. Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002). A reasonable officer in Johnson's position would have understood that forcibly taking down an unarmed, non-threatening individual experiencing a mental health crisis, without attempting less intrusive means first, violated the Fourth Amendment.

The fact pattern here closely parallels Tatum and Drummond, where we held that officers violated clearly established rights by using significant force against mentally ill individuals who posed no threat. Martinez's request to speak with a crisis counselor should have alerted Johnson to her mental state and the need for a more measured approach.

Johnson argues that he faced rapidly evolving circumstances requiring split-second decisions. While we recognize the difficulties of police work, the clearly established law in this circuit gave Johnson adequate notice that his actions were unconstitutional. The qualified immunity doctrine does not protect officers who violate clearly established constitutional rights, even in challenging situations.

IV. CONCLUSION

We hold that Deputy Johnson violated Jane Martinez's clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. Accordingly, Johnson is not entitled to qualified immunity.

REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

COLLINS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:

I agree with the majority that Johnson used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. However, I respectfully dissent from the conclusion that the right was clearly established.

While prior cases establish general principles about force and mental illness, I do not believe they gave Johnson "fair warning" that his specific conduct was unconstitutional. The cases cited by the majority involved different factual circumstances, and reasonable officers could disagree about the proper response to Martinez's behavior.

Qualified immunity exists precisely to protect officers in situations where the law is not clearly established. I would affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.
